        <h3>I've been to 15 different states this year</h3>
        <p> Took a road trip this year and have just generally traveled all over the US, even during quarantine! Best social distancing vacation is one you take in an RV.</p>
        <h3>I have 5 siblings</h3>
        <p>Both of my parents are remarried and I have a lot of step siblings.</p>
        <h3>I'm into cave diving</h3>
        <p>I love being deep, deep underground; it's incredible.</p>
